The game is built around a series of interconnected systems that allow players to manage resources, automate tasks, and progress through a farming simulation. (Quality of life not included in this breakdown lol)\nGame Core Loop # flowchart LR A[Growing Crop] --\u003e B[Progression] B[Progression] --\u003e C[Idle Waiting] C[Idle Waiting] --\u003e A[Growing Crop] For non-programmers, the core loop of the game can be summarized as follows:\nStart the game and let crops grow idly. Check if any crops are mature for harvesting. If yes, harvest the crops and collect resources. Allocate resources either to reinvest in the farm or hold for later. Decide whether to buy upgrades or hire new helpers. Repeat the loop. Aesthetics # User Interface # The user interface of Rusty‚Äôs Retirement is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly. Art Style # The Game height is around 320px, which is a common resolution for pixel art games. This resolution allows for detailed pixel art while maintaining a nostalgic aesthetic. The game‚Äôs visuals are charming and contribute to the overall relaxing atmosphere, making it visually appealing to players who enjoy pixel art games.\nSound Design # Chilling and relaxing music. If you have any idea what type of music this is, please let me know. But for me its just chill.\nFor the SFX, there is not much since the game intent to not distract you while you are doing other tasks. The game has a few sound effects for actions like planting, harvesting, and watering crops, but they are subtle and not intrusive.\nProgression and Replayability # Building \u0026amp; NPCs # You can build various structures and hire NPCs to help automate tasks. Some NPCs has unique abilities that can help you progress faster, or provide unique benefits such as decoration or new resources\nNew Crops # Well, bored of the same crops? You can unlock new crops by progressing through the game and completing certain tasks. Each crop has its own growth time, yield, and resource value, adding variety to your farming experience.\nStats View # I forgot which NPC that unlock this, but you can view your stats and progress in the game. This feature allows you to track your achievements, resources collected, and overall farm performance. It adds a layer of depth to the game, reflecting the player‚Äôs progress and providing a sense of accomplishment.\nAnimals # They are moving around the farm, produce i think its fertilizer, and can be fed to increase their productivity.\nBee!üêù # They need Berry bushes to produce honey, i love them when they are flying around the farm. They are cute and adds a nice touch to the game‚Äôs atmosphere.\nDecoration # Players can customize their farm with various decorative items, adding a personal touch to their environment. This feature enhances the cozy atmosphere of the game and allows for creative expression. Not all of the decorations are just for aesthetics, the sign post can be used to mark what crops are planted in a specific area.\nStart Over (Reset) # Unlock new Map or change your layout by creating new playthroughs. This feature allows players to reset their farm and start over, providing a fresh experience with new challenges and opportunities. It adds replayability to the game, encouraging players to experiment with different strategies and layouts.\nUnique \u0026amp; Standout Features # Widget like Interface # The game features a unique widget-like interface that allows players to keep the game running in a small window while they engage in other tasks. This design choice makes it easy to play Rusty‚Äôs Retirement alongside other activities, enhancing its idle gameplay experience and standout from traditional idle games.\nIdle Gameplay # Since the game is designed to run in a small window, it allows players to engage in other activities while the game progresses. This idle gameplay mechanic is a key feature, enabling players to manage their farm without needing to be constantly active in the game. So it fell on Cozy Genre, which is a sub-genre of idle games that focuses on relaxing and casual gameplay.\nPixel Art Style # Its Pixel Art with a cozy aesthetic is another standout feature. The game‚Äôs visuals are charming and nostalgic, appealing to players who enjoy pixel art games. The art style contributes to the overall relaxing atmosphere of the game, making it visually appealing.\nGrid and free will # The game features a grid-based layout that allows players to place crops and structures freely. This grid system provides a structured yet flexible environment for players to manage their farm, enabling them to optimize their layout for efficiency and aesthetics.\nSummary # This game is nice 8/10, I love the widget-like interface that allows me to play it while doing other tasks. The game is designed to be played in a small window, making it easy to engage in other activities on your computer while managing your farm. The idle gameplay mechanic is a key feature, allowing players to progress without needing to be constantly active in the game. However, there is lack of end game content.\nFor Future Me: https://www.imgchest.com/p/a8465mwnwyx\n","date":"10 July 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/rusty-and-the-reborn-of-widget/","section":"Posts","summary":"\u003ch2 class=\"relative group\"\u003eRusty and the Reborn of Widget \n    \u003cdiv id=\"rusty-and-the-reborn-of-widget\" class=\"anchor\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n    \n    \u003cspan\n        class=\"absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 ltr:-left-6 rtl:-right-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100\"\u003e\n        \u003ca class=\"group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700\"\n            style=\"text-decoration-line: none !important;\" href=\"#rusty-and-the-reborn-of-widget\" aria-label=\"Anchor\"\u003e#\u003c/a\u003e\n    \u003c/span\u003e        \n    \n\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure\u003e\n    \u003cimg class=\"my-0 rounded-md\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Rusty Retirement\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2666510/extras/close-up.gif?t=1743519099\" /\u003e\n\n  \n\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 class=\"relative group\"\u003eIntroduction \n    \u003cdiv id=\"introduction\" class=\"anchor\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n    \n    \u003cspan\n        class=\"absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 ltr:-left-6 rtl:-right-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100\"\u003e\n        \u003ca class=\"group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700\"\n            style=\"text-decoration-line: none !important;\" href=\"#introduction\" aria-label=\"Anchor\"\u003e#\u003c/a\u003e\n    \u003c/span\u003e        \n    \n\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRusty‚Äôs Retirement is an idle farming simulator developed and published by Mister Morris Games.

You can also script in C#, C++, or VisualScript. Its MIT license means zero royalties or subscriptions.\nUnity # Unity supports both 2D and 3D out of the box, with a primary C# API and a massive Asset Store full of plugins, templates, and art assets. Three render pipelines (URP and HDRP) cover everything from mobile to high-end PC (However, I find it difficult to work around).\nUnreal # Unreal Engine (latest UE5) shines in photorealism thanks to Nanite (virtualized geometry) and Lumen (dynamic global illumination and reflections). Blueprint visual scripting complements its C++ core, giving you AAA-grade tools from day one, so no need to reinvent the wheel. I would like to try it out again later this year.\nPerformance # Godot excels in 2D, offering lightweight runtime assemblies and sub-millisecond frame times even on modest hardware. Its 3D capabilities have improved dramatically in 4.x but still lag behind the giants in extremely complex scenes. Unity performs well across platforms but can incur overhead in heavy HDRP scenes or when loading large asset bundles. Profiling and manual optimizations are often required for top-tier performance. Unreal delivers unrivalled fidelity and Nanite can stream billions of triangles without hiccups, and Lumen brings real-time GI to life, provided you have a high-end GPU(but you need to know the basic of baking or you will sacrifice the performance a lot on the user). Community \u0026amp; Ecosystem # Godot has a passionate open-source community, with rapid iteration on features and a growing plugin repository, though its third-party asset library remains smaller, but I\u0026rsquo;ve seen it growing that Unity assets start supporting Godot and Unreal. Unity boasts the largest developer base, extensive documentation, tutorials, and an Asset Store that can save weeks of work‚Äîat the expense of subscription fees for larger teams. However, Unity 6 has been criticized for its lack of innovation in recent years, with many developers feeling it has stagnated compared to Godot and Unreal. There is recent CTO shuffle which has left many in the community wondering about the future direction of Unity. Unreal offers a robust Marketplace and deep integration with Quixel Megascans. Documentation and sample projects are extensive, but the engine‚Äôs complexity can intimidate beginners. Its been use in film and AAA games for years, so you can find a wealth of resources, it feels like a factory with everything you need to build a game, but it can be overwhelming for new users. When to Choose Which # Godot as your Swiss Army knife: Need rapid prototyping, 2D games, or tooling? Godot lets you move fast without licensing headaches. Unity 6 is lacking: Despite broad support and a mature pipeline, Unity 6 still hasn‚Äôt closed the gap on Godot‚Äôs 2D workflow or matched Unreal‚Äôs plug-and-play AAA features, making it feel less compelling as a true all-rounder. Unreal for indie AAA polish: Small teams chasing console-quality visuals, advanced physics, or large-scale worlds will find Unreal‚Äôs toolset unrivalled, if they can handle the learning curve and hardware demands(like at least a mid-range GPU, my 3000 series laptop is caught lacking). Conclusion # Each engine has its sweet spot. Godot offers speed, flexibility, and zero cost which is ideal for indies and rapid prototyping. Unity remains a solid generalist with vast community resources, for students a lot of studios are still using Unity, but faces growing competition with Godot and Unreal, especially for AAA. Unreal stands alone for cutting-edge visuals and scale, making it the go-to for indies who want AAA without building a custom engine.\nPersonally I picked Godot for my next project because it aligns with my need for rapid iteration, lightweight, and ease of use, especially in 2D. However, I‚Äôm excited to explore Unreal for future projects that demand high-end graphics and complex interactions.\n","date":"5 June 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/godot-vs-unity-unreal/","section":"Posts","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn this post, I compare Godot, Unity, and Unreal Engine across features, performance, and community support to help you choose the right engine for your next project.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 class=\"relative group\"\u003eFeatures \n    \u003cdiv id=\"features\" class=\"anchor\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n    \n    \u003cspan\n        class=\"absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 ltr:-left-6 rtl:-right-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100\"\u003e\n        \u003ca class=\"group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700\"\n            style=\"text-decoration-line: none !important;\" href=\"#features\" aria-label=\"Anchor\"\u003e#\u003c/a\u003e\n    \u003c/span\u003e        \n    \n\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 class=\"relative group\"\u003eGodot \n    \u003cdiv id=\"godot\" class=\"anchor\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n    \n    \u003cspan\n        class=\"absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 ltr:-left-6 rtl:-right-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100\"\u003e\n        \u003ca class=\"group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700\"\n            style=\"text-decoration-line: none !important;\" href=\"#godot\" aria-label=\"Anchor\"\u003e#\u003c/a\u003e\n    \u003c/span\u003e        \n    \n\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure\u003e\n      \u003cimg\n    class=\"my-0 rounded-md\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"low\" alt=\"godot\"\n    srcset=\"\n      /posts/godot-vs-unity-unreal/godot_hu_9108ed7a1c86235a.png 330w,\n      /posts/godot-vs-unity-unreal/godot_hu_306af4e69f5a17e5.png 660w,\n      /posts/godot-vs-unity-unreal/godot_hu_ec79f0964b60e1bc.png 1280w\"\n    data-zoom-src=\"/posts/godot-vs-unity-unreal/godot.png\"\n    src=\"/posts/godot-vs-unity-unreal/godot.png\"\n  /\u003e\n\n  \n\u003c/figure\u003e\n\nGodot‚Äôs node-based scene system and integrated GDScript make it incredibly approachable.

I\u0026rsquo;ll discuss the unique challenges and advantages we encountered during development, as well as how each approach impacted player engagement and immersion.\nWhats the Difference? # THE MATH behind 2D and 3D games is fundamentally different. In a 2D game, the world is flat, and all interactions occur on a single plane(x and y). This simplicity allows for easier asset creation and faster development cycles. However, it can limit the depth of immersion and spatial interaction. Howevery you could use parallax scrolling to create a sense of depth, but it still lacks the full 3D experience. So it\u0026rsquo;s just depth illusion.\nIn contrast, 3D games operate in a three-dimensional space (x, y, and z), allowing for more complex interactions and a greater sense of immersion. The math behind 3D games involves transformations, projections, and lighting calculations, which can be more challenging to implement but result in a richer player experience.\nDevelopment Challenges # 2D Horror Game # The 2D horror game we developed had its own set of challenges. Creating a compelling atmosphere with limited visual depth required us to focus heavily on art style, sound design, and narrative. We used 2D lighting techniques to evoke a sense of nostalgia while incorporating eerie soundscapes to enhance the horror elements.\n3D Horror Game # The 3D horror game presented a different set of challenges. The complexity of 3D modeling, animation, and physics required a more robust development pipeline. We had to consider camera angles, lighting effects, and spatial audio to create an immersive environment. The increased detail in graphics allowed for more realistic scares, but it also demanded more resources and time.\nWhats the similarities? # Both 2D and 3D horror games share common elements that contribute to the horror experience. These include:\nAtmosphere: Both types of games rely on creating a tense and unsettling atmosphere through visuals, sound, and narrative. Storytelling: Engaging narratives are crucial in both formats to keep players invested and heighten the horror experience. Like why the player is in this situation, and what is the backstory of the horror. Gameplay Mechanics: Core gameplay mechanics, such as exploration, puzzle-solving, and survival elements, can be found in both 2D and 3D horror games. These mechanics are essential for player engagement and immersion. however, the implementation may differ due to the dimensionality of the game. Pacing: Effective pacing is essential in both formats to build tension and deliver scares at the right moments. Since you don\u0026rsquo;t want to overwhelm the player with too many scares at once, or too little jumpscare, you need to balance the pacing of the game. Environmental Storytelling: Both formats can use the environment to tell a story, revealing lore and backstory through visual elements and interactions. This in my opinion is the most important part of a horror game, because it can make the player feel like they are in a real world, and the horror is happening in that world.

Containers package an application and its dependencies together, ensuring that it runs consistently across different environments. This is particularly useful for game servers like Minecraft, where you want to ensure a stable and reproducible environment for players.\nWhy Use Docker for Minecraft? # Using Docker for a Minecraft server has several advantages:\nPortability: Easily move your server between different machines or cloud providers. Isolation: Each server runs in its own container, preventing conflicts with other applications. Scalability: Quickly scale your server up or down based on player demand. Consistency: Ensure that the server runs the same way in development, testing, and production environments. Easy Updates: Update the server software without affecting the host system or other containers.

Fortnite‚Äôs UEFN finally lets us script, model, and publish our own islands with almost the same freedom as a standalone Unreal project‚Äîso I‚Äôm building a 100-level gauntlet that feels familiar to Minecraft veterans yet leverages Fortnite movement (mantle, slide, sprint) and visuals.\nHigh-Level Design # Goal Details 100 distinct checkpoints Each level lasts 10‚Äì40 seconds for an average player. Rising difficulty curve Every 10 levels introduces a new mechanic (e.g., air vents, moving platforms, slide-jumps). No dead-ends Miss a jump? Fall zones funnel players to the last checkpoint‚Äîno lengthy back-tracking. Speedrun friendly Integrated timer, gold/silver/bronze splits, and leaderboard widget. I‚Äôm blocking out levels in groups of 10 to iterate faster, then art-pass once the movement feels right.\nTools \u0026amp; Workflow # Grey-box in UEFN with simple shapes and the ParkourCheckDevice (custom Verse script storing progress). Playtest locally with friends via private code; gather heat-map data on where players fall. Art pass in chunks: replace primitives with stylised geometry, enable Lumen for soft lighting, and sprinkle VFX. Performance sweep on Switch and last-gen consoles; trim materials or swap meshes as needed. Push to Creative Sandbox for public playtest ‚Üí collect analytics ‚Üí repeat. Current UEFN Pain Points (May 2025) # Limitation Impact on a 100-Level Parkour Map Practical Work-around Rapid, unstable feature updates Weekly client patches can change the editor UI or Verse APIs overnight, forcing unplanned re-builds. Keep a frozen branch in source control; wait 48 h after each release before upgrading your main dev build. Updates sometimes break working content Projects that opened fine yesterday may throw Verse compile errors or fail to load checkpoints after a hot-fix. Pin every milestone to a tagged Git commit; test new versions in a scratch copy and roll back if critical devices fail. Metaverse-first roadmap Epic‚Äôs priority list skews toward big, shared world features‚Äîsmaller QoL requests (e.g., finer timer controls) slide down the queue. Track the Trello roadmap and design levels around what already exists; up-vote community tickets to raise visibility. Less-diverse player base than Roblox Fortnite‚Äôs audience is ~60 % ages 18‚Äì24, whereas Roblox remains majority under-16; feedback may tilt toward shooter veterans, not younger casuals. Recruit broader testers via Discord servers, TikTok, and school esports clubs; consider cross-posting demos on Roblox to reach younger players. High-end PC strongly recommended UEFN editing is sluggish on laptops without a discrete GPU and \u0026lt;16 GB RAM, slowing iteration on large obstacle courses. Develop on a desktop with ‚â•16 GB RAM + mid-range GPU, or stream UEFN remotely from a cloud workstation; keep grey-box assets lightweight until final art pass. Progress Snapshot (Update November 15, 2024) # Levels completed: 30/100 playable Art-pass finished: 1-10 are proven cool Average clear time: 6 min 12 s (internal test) Most-failed jump: Level 8 triple corner jump (32 % fail rate) Bugs: Vent momentum boost sometimes stacks (investigating) Next Steps # Finish grey-box for levels 40‚Äì60 (introduce ice slide mechanic). Polish existing timer UI and integrate global leaderboard service. Record a teaser clip for TikTok/X (target 30 s vertical). Reach out to the Parkour Paradise creator for a friendly shout-out once we‚Äôre near beta. Get Involved # Playtest: Want early access? DM me on Bsky for a private island code. Feedback: Join the Discord and drop your checkpoint completion times. Collab: 3D artists or Verse scripters looking for a side project are welcome, let‚Äôs polish this to a shine!

So let\u0026rsquo;s break it down what is Marvel Snap.\nMarvel Snap, developed by Second Dinner Studios and published by Nuverse, has emerged as a fast-paced collectible card game sensation. This review delves into the captivating world of Marvel Snap, where players construct superhero teams and engage in strategic battles across both PC and mobile platforms.\nOverview # Marvel Snap unfolds in the Marvel Universe, featuring beloved characters like Hulk, Spiderman, and Nightcrawler. Players, armed with their own decks, vie for supremacy in a game that spans just six turns, ensuring quick, action-packed gameplay.\nObjective # The primary goal is to secure two out of the three central locations on the game board by the final turn. Success hinges on outsmarting opponents and maximizing power at each location.\nGameplay # The simultaneous completion of turns injects excitement into every moment, making Marvel Snap an ideal on-the-go game, especially for mobile devices.\nCards # Each card in Marvel Snap has a Energy and Power value assigned to it. You start off by creating your deck with the cards available to you. Winning duels will reward you with credits and card boosters, which you can use to upgrade your card rarity.\nLocations # There are three locations in the center of the game board. Each location has a different effect that will help or hinder your strategy based on your card deck. The location will be revealed one by one every turn. So you have to adapt your strategy based on the location. There are over 140 locations in the game, so you have to be prepared for anything.\nSnap! # Snap is a mechanic that will be unlocked after you play the game for a while. It\u0026rsquo;s a special move that doubles your reward if you win the duel. But if you lose, you will lose double of your rewards too. So you have to be careful when using this feature. It\u0026rsquo;s apply to both player, so you can use this for psychological warfare.\nFun Factor # Previous Nextsads Why this game is so fun and addictive? Let\u0026rsquo;s break it down.\nSimple Gameplay # The rules, initially appearing complex, quickly become intuitive with an interactive tutorial, making Marvel Snap easy to learn and play. The game\u0026rsquo;s fast-paced nature, with each turn lasting only 30 seconds, ensures that players are constantly engaged. The game\u0026rsquo;s short duration also makes it ideal for mobile devices, allowing players to enjoy a quick game on the go.\nVisuals and Sound Effects # Stunning visuals exemplified in every unique card, contribute to a captivating gaming experience. The game\u0026rsquo;s vibrant colors and dynamic animations further enhance the visual appeal every turn you play or interact with the game. The music however, is a bit repetitive and could be improved, such as adding more tracks or allowing players to choose their own music, just like what Valve did on Counter-Strike 2. Unlike the music, the sound effects are well-designed and add to the overall experience. Especially the sound effects of the cards, which are unique to each card and are very satisfying to hear.\nCard Collection and Leveling System # Since Marvel Snap has a lot of cards, it\u0026rsquo;s make the game more dynamic and fun. You cannot expect what card your opponent will play next. So it feels like a gamble, but a fun gamble. The extensive card variety and leveling system, achievable through in-game currency or casual play, add dynamic and unpredictable elements to the game. Player could upgrade their cards to higher rarity, which won\u0026rsquo;t increase the power of the card, but will unlock new card animations and sound effects.\nRegular Updates and Active Community # Based on SteamDB accesed on January 2024, Marvel Snap has a very active playerbase and a great number of positive reviews. The game is also available on mobile devices, which further expands its playerbase. Frequent updates, including new cards, locations, cosmetics, and events, maintain Marvel Snap\u0026rsquo;s freshness. The active community on Discord and Reddit r/MarvelSnap further enhances the gaming experience.\nConclusion # Marvel Snap successfully combines unique mechanics with engaging content.

Pandemic # Just like others, online school is boring. So i started to learn game development. I started with Godot Engine since its lite and doesn\u0026rsquo;t need a lot of resources. I started with a simple game, a platformer game.\nAGI # Then coincidentally a few months later AGI held a Game Development Competition. So i decided to join the competition. The theme of the competition is Educational Game for Vocational Training. I made an educational game about coffee industry for Kementerian Ketenagakerjaan, it narrates how Luwak made coffee from coffee plantation. Won second place despite being the only high school and able to beat a team of 3 people from vocational high school by myself, it was turning point for me.\nHere is the clip of the game called Luwak Adventure that i made:\nCompfest 14 # After the competition, i decided to join another competition. This time it\u0026rsquo;s Compfest 14. I formed a small team consist of 3 people. We decided to make a game about metroidvania. For 30 days of struggle sadly we didn\u0026rsquo;t make it through the final. But we still proud of our work and we try to do it better next time. Mainly i\u0026rsquo;m the one who did the game design, UI programming, and some of the art. Deka for the more complex programming such as the platformer physics, game mechanics, he also compose the music and draw the main character. Others is Zio for pixel artist and Azfa for additional programming and level design.\nHere is the clip of the game we made called May I Return that we made:\nGACCI 2022 # After Compfest 14, i decided to join another competition. This time it\u0026rsquo;s GACCI 2022. Another competition show up, this time it\u0026rsquo;s a competition held by Binus University. This competition is a bit different from the previous one. This time we have to make a game design document(which i never did before), so i eager to learn what is game design document. I got into the final and some of my friends from AGI Competition also get into the final. We have to do sort of game pitching for the jury. I got the 1st place and my friends got the 2nd place. Apparently i made it to the final because of my game design document is the longest and the most complex one. I tried to make a fusion game of Papers Please and Cooking Mama on Indonesian Independence Day theme. The prize is a fullscholarship for Binus University.\nGIM JAM ITB 2023 # It\u0026rsquo;s a 7 days game jam basicly, with the theme of \u0026ldquo;Meme Indonesia\u0026rdquo;. I made a game about Meth, Magician, and Latto-latto. Because meme is vary, i decided to put 3 meme in one game. I made it to become the Winner of Best Game Award. I made this game with Deka, Zio. We made this game using kinematic skeleton to animate the character, it\u0026rsquo;s save a lot of time.\nGlobal Game Jam 2023 # It\u0026rsquo;s a 48 hours offline game jam with \u0026ldquo;Root\u0026rdquo; as a theme. The event supported by GameLan.YK, I made the level design based on the Team Lead direction and searched for some audio assets for the game. I met a lot of new people and had a lot of fun, we got a visit from Kementerian Pariwisata dan Ekonomi Kreatif, Muhammad Neil El Himam and Sandiaga Uno.\nHere is the clip of the game we made called Stay Hydrated! that we made:\nand here is the recap of the event:\nTono # My experiment for 3D game, probably my shamest work. I made this game for Vocachamp 2023. Made with the new Godot Engine 4, 3D assets with Blender, audio with BeepBox, drawing with Krita, video editing software with KDEnLive. I made a Hamster Ball game like. Beside my shamest work i also proud of this work because i made it all by myself. I made the 3D assets, the music, the sound effect, the game design, the programming, the level design, the UI, the video editing, and the game trailer. I made this game in 2 weeks.\n","date":"1 January 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/school-chaos/","section":"Posts","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI made this blog for my past project that i do when i was on highschool.\n\u003ch1 id=\"typeit-ddaf1096996a15f40134186e45fab7aa\"\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\n\n\u003cscript\u003e\n    document.addEventListener(\"DOMContentLoaded\", function () {\n      new TypeIt(\"#typeit-ddaf1096996a15f40134186e45fab7aa\", {\n        strings: [\"\",\"    This is where it all begins...\",\"\"],\n        speed:  100 ,\n        lifeLike:  true ,\n        startDelay:  100 ,\n        breakLines:  false ,\n        waitUntilVisible:  true ,\n        loop:  false \n      }).go();\n    });\n\u003c/script\u003e\u003c/p\u003e","title":"My Highschool Game Project","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"1 January 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/school/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"School","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"28 December 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/blog/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Blog","type":"tags"},{"content":"This is my first post for my blog.
