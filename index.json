You can also script in C#, C++, or VisualScript, and everything lives as files on disk—perfect for version control. Its MIT license means zero royalties or subscriptions.\nUnity # Unity supports both 2D and 3D out of the box, with a primary C# API and a massive Asset Store full of plugins, templates, and art assets. Three render pipelines (URP and HDRP) cover everything from mobile to high-end PC (However, I find it difficult to work around).\nUnreal # Unreal Engine (latest UE5) shines in photorealism thanks to Nanite (virtualized geometry) and Lumen (dynamic global illumination and reflections). Blueprint visual scripting complements its C++ core, giving you AAA-grade tools from day one, so no need to reinvent the wheel. I would like to try it out again later this year.\nPerformance # Godot excels in 2D, offering lightweight runtime assemblies and sub-millisecond frame times even on modest hardware. Its 3D capabilities have improved dramatically in 4.x but still lag behind the giants in extremely complex scenes. Unity performs well across platforms but can incur overhead in heavy HDRP scenes or when loading large asset bundles. Profiling and manual optimizations are often required for top-tier performance. Unreal delivers unrivalled fidelity and scale—Nanite can stream billions of triangles without hiccups, and Lumen brings real-time GI to life, provided you have a high-end GPU(but you need to know the basic of baking or you will sacrifice the performance a lot on the user). Community \u0026amp; Ecosystem # Godot has a passionate open-source community, with rapid iteration on features and a growing plugin repository, though its third-party asset library remains smaller, but ive seen it growing that unity assets start supporting godot and unreal. Unity boasts the largest developer base, extensive documentation, tutorials, and an Asset Store that can save weeks of work—at the expense of subscription fees for larger teams. However, Unity 6 has been criticized for its lack of innovation in recent years, with many developers feeling it has stagnated compared to Godot and Unreal. There is recent CTO shuffle which has left many in the community wondering about the future direction of Unity. Unreal offers a robust Marketplace and deep integration with Quixel Megascans. Documentation and sample projects are extensive, but the engine’s complexity can intimidate beginners. Its been use in film and AAA games for years, so you can find a wealth of resources, it feels like a factory with everything you need to build a game, but it can be overwhelming for new users. When to Choose Which # Godot as your Swiss Army knife: Need rapid prototyping, 2D games, or tooling? Godot lets you move fast without licensing headaches. Unity 6 is lacking: Despite broad support and a mature pipeline, Unity 6 still hasn’t closed the gap on Godot’s 2D workflow or matched Unreal’s plug-and-play AAA features, making it feel less compelling as a true all-rounder. Unreal for indie AAA polish: Small teams chasing console-quality visuals, advanced physics, or large-scale worlds will find Unreal’s toolset unrivalled—if they can handle the learning curve and hardware demands. Conclusion # Each engine has its sweet spot. Godot offers speed, flexibility, and zero cost—ideal for indies and rapid prototyping. Unity remains a solid generalist with vast community resources but faces growing competition. Unreal stands alone for cutting-edge visuals and scale, making it the go-to for indies who want AAA without building a custom engine.\nPersonally i picked Godot for my next project because it aligns with my need for rapid iteration, lightweight, and ease of use, especially in 2D. However, I’m excited to explore Unreal for future projects that demand high-end graphics and complex interactions.\n","date":"5 June 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/godot-vs-unity-unreal/","section":"Posts","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn this post, I compare Godot, Unity, and Unreal Engine across features, performance, and community support to help you choose the right engine for your next project.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 class=\"relative group\"\u003eFeatures \n    \u003cdiv id=\"features\" class=\"anchor\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n    \n    \u003cspan\n        class=\"absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 ltr:-left-6 rtl:-right-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100\"\u003e\n        \u003ca class=\"group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700\"\n            style=\"text-decoration-line: none !important;\" href=\"#features\" aria-label=\"Anchor\"\u003e#\u003c/a\u003e\n    \u003c/span\u003e        \n    \n\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 class=\"relative group\"\u003eGodot \n    \u003cdiv id=\"godot\" class=\"anchor\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n    \n    \u003cspan\n        class=\"absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 ltr:-left-6 rtl:-right-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100\"\u003e\n        \u003ca class=\"group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700\"\n            style=\"text-decoration-line: none !important;\" href=\"#godot\" aria-label=\"Anchor\"\u003e#\u003c/a\u003e\n    \u003c/span\u003e        \n    \n\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure\u003e\n      \u003cimg\n    class=\"my-0 rounded-md\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"low\" alt=\"godot\"\n    srcset=\"\n      /posts/godot-vs-unity-unreal/godot_hu_9108ed7a1c86235a.png 330w,\n      /posts/godot-vs-unity-unreal/godot_hu_306af4e69f5a17e5.png 660w,\n      /posts/godot-vs-unity-unreal/godot_hu_ec79f0964b60e1bc.png 1280w\"\n    data-zoom-src=\"/posts/godot-vs-unity-unreal/godot.png\"\n    src=\"/posts/godot-vs-unity-unreal/godot.png\"\n  /\u003e\n\n  \n\u003c/figure\u003e\n\nGodot’s node-based scene system and integrated GDScript make it incredibly approachable.

I\u0026rsquo;ll discuss the unique challenges and advantages we encountered during development, as well as how each approach impacted player engagement and immersion.\nWhats the Difference? # THE MATH behind 2D and 3D games is fundamentally different. In a 2D game, the world is flat, and all interactions occur on a single plane(x and y). This simplicity allows for easier asset creation and faster development cycles. However, it can limit the depth of immersion and spatial interaction. Howevery you could use parallax scrolling to create a sense of depth, but it still lacks the full 3D experience. So it\u0026rsquo;s just depth illusion.\nIn contrast, 3D games operate in a three-dimensional space (x, y, and z), allowing for more complex interactions and a greater sense of immersion. The math behind 3D games involves transformations, projections, and lighting calculations, which can be more challenging to implement but result in a richer player experience.\nDevelopment Challenges # 2D Horror Game # The 2D horror game we developed had its own set of challenges. Creating a compelling atmosphere with limited visual depth required us to focus heavily on art style, sound design, and narrative. We used 2D lighting techniques to evoke a sense of nostalgia while incorporating eerie soundscapes to enhance the horror elements.\n3D Horror Game # The 3D horror game presented a different set of challenges. The complexity of 3D modeling, animation, and physics required a more robust development pipeline. We had to consider camera angles, lighting effects, and spatial audio to create an immersive environment. The increased detail in graphics allowed for more realistic scares, but it also demanded more resources and time.\nWhats the similarities? # Both 2D and 3D horror games share common elements that contribute to the horror experience. These include:\nAtmosphere: Both types of games rely on creating a tense and unsettling atmosphere through visuals, sound, and narrative. Storytelling: Engaging narratives are crucial in both formats to keep players invested and heighten the horror experience. Like why the player is in this situation, and what is the backstory of the horror. Gameplay Mechanics: Core gameplay mechanics, such as exploration, puzzle-solving, and survival elements, can be found in both 2D and 3D horror games. These mechanics are essential for player engagement and immersion. however, the implementation may differ due to the dimensionality of the game. Pacing: Effective pacing is essential in both formats to build tension and deliver scares at the right moments. Since you don\u0026rsquo;t want to overwhelm the player with too many scares at once, or too little jumpscare, you need to balance the pacing of the game. Environmental Storytelling: Both formats can use the environment to tell a story, revealing lore and backstory through visual elements and interactions. This in my opinion is the most important part of a horror game, because it can make the player feel like they are in a real world, and the horror is happening in that world.

Great for cross-platform titles (Xbox, PC, mobile). Azure Container Apps / AKS – Useful when you need custom match instances or authoritative physics servers. Azure Front Door + Anycast – Global entry point; auto-routes players to the nearest region and mitigates basic DDoS. Azure OpenAI Service – Handy for procedural dialogue or real-time moderation without juggling a separate OpenAI account. Cost gotchas\nLeaving a compute node in Stopped (Allocated) still bills vCPU/RAM—remember to deallocate. PlayFab’s free tier is generous for indies (up to 100 K MAU) but jumps sharply once you exceed limits. AWS for game back-ends # GameLift – Managed fleet + FlexMatch matchmaking. Per-second billing and built-in Spot capacity make it inexpensive for spiky player traffic. Global Accelerator – Anycast IPs with UDP acceleration; lowers first-hop latency for shooter or MOBA net-code. Graviton (Arm) EC2 – Up to 40 % cheaper CPU if your dedicated server binary builds for Arm. GameSparks – Managed player data \u0026amp; Cloud Code option if you prefer AWS over PlayFab. Cost perks\nWhen an EC2 instance or GameLift fleet is fully stopped, compute costs drop to zero—only EBS persists. 100 GB of free egress offsets patch distribution or CDN spillover.

Always test from your players’ ISPs. There are not much differences here\nFinal thoughts # Go Azure if you want PlayFab’s turnkey LiveOps or cheaper Windows licences, or you plan heavy AI integration via Azure OpenAI. Go AWS if you need per-second fleet scaling, aggressively stop servers in off-hours, or want to squeeze cost with Arm Spot instances. Whichever cloud you pick, measure first, refactor later.

This is particularly useful for game servers like Minecraft, where you want to ensure a stable and reproducible environment for players.\nWhy Use Docker for Minecraft? # Using Docker for a Minecraft server has several advantages:\nPortability: Easily move your server between different machines or cloud providers. Isolation: Each server runs in its own container, preventing conflicts with other applications. Scalability: Quickly scale your server up or down based on player demand. Consistency: Ensure that the server runs the same way in development, testing, and production environments.

Fortnite’s UEFN finally lets us script, model, and publish our own islands with almost the same freedom as a standalone Unreal project—so I’m building a 100-level gauntlet that feels familiar to Minecraft veterans yet leverages Fortnite movement (mantle, slide, sprint) and visuals.\nHigh-Level Design # Goal Details 100 distinct checkpoints Each level lasts 10–40 seconds for an average player. Rising difficulty curve Every 10 levels introduces a new mechanic (e.g., air vents, moving platforms, slide-jumps). No dead-ends Miss a jump? Fall zones funnel players to the last checkpoint—no lengthy back-tracking. Speedrun friendly Integrated timer, gold/silver/bronze splits, and leaderboard widget. I’m blocking out levels in groups of 10 to iterate faster, then art-pass once the movement feels right.\nTools \u0026amp; Workflow # Grey-box in UEFN with simple shapes and the ParkourCheckDevice (custom Verse script storing progress). Playtest locally with friends via private code; gather heat-map data on where players fall. Art pass in chunks: replace primitives with stylised geometry, enable Lumen for soft lighting, and sprinkle VFX. Performance sweep on Switch and last-gen consoles; trim materials or swap meshes as needed. Push to Creative Sandbox for public playtest → collect analytics → repeat. Tip: Keep the default player character capsule for scale reference. Swapping to custom skins too early threw off jump distances more than once.\nCurrent UEFN Pain Points (May 2025) # Limitation Impact on a 100-Level Parkour Map Practical Work-around Rapid, unstable feature updates Weekly client patches can change the editor UI or Verse APIs overnight, forcing unplanned re-builds. Keep a frozen branch in source control; wait 48 h after each release before upgrading your main dev build. Updates sometimes break working content Projects that opened fine yesterday may throw Verse compile errors or fail to load checkpoints after a hot-fix. Pin every milestone to a tagged Git commit; test new versions in a scratch copy and roll back if critical devices fail. Metaverse-first roadmap Epic’s priority list skews toward big, shared-world features—smaller QoL requests (e.g., finer timer controls) slide down the queue. Track the Trello roadmap and design levels around what already exists; up-vote community tickets to raise visibility. Less-diverse player base than Roblox Fortnite’s audience is ~60 % ages 18–24, whereas Roblox remains majority under-16; feedback may tilt toward shooter veterans, not younger casuals. Recruit broader testers via Discord servers, TikTok, and school esports clubs; consider cross-posting demos on Roblox to reach younger players. High-end PC strongly recommended UEFN editing is sluggish on laptops without a discrete GPU and \u0026lt;16 GB RAM, slowing iteration on large obstacle courses. Develop on a desktop with ≥16 GB RAM + mid-range GPU, or stream UEFN remotely from a cloud workstation; keep grey-box assets lightweight until final art pass. Progress Snapshot (Update November 15, 2024) # Levels completed: 30/100 playable Art-pass finished: 1-10 are proven cool Average clear time: 6 min 12 s (internal test) Most-failed jump: Level 8 triple corner jump (32 % fail rate) Bugs: Vent momentum boost sometimes stacks (investigating) Next Steps # Finish grey-box for levels 40–60 (introduce ice slide mechanic). Polish existing timer UI and integrate global leaderboard service. Record a teaser clip for TikTok/X (target 30 s vertical). Reach out to the Parkour Paradise creator for a friendly shout-out once we’re near beta. Get Involved # Playtest: Want early access? DM me on Bsky for a private island code. Feedback: Join the Discord and drop your checkpoint completion times. Collab: 3D artists or Verse scripters looking for a side project are welcome—let’s polish this to a shine! Stay tuned—next dev-blog will cover ice mechanics and the first public stress test. 🚀\n","date":"15 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/uefn-parkour-maps-limitations/","section":"Posts","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure\u003e\n      \u003cimg\n    class=\"my-0 rounded-md\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"low\" alt=\"UEFN\"\n    srcset=\"\n      /posts/uefn-parkour-maps-limitations/image_hu_68454c566f37e394.png 330w,\n      /posts/uefn-parkour-maps-limitations/image_hu_ea46941e30d1a36e.png 660w,\n      /posts/uefn-parkour-maps-limitations/image_hu_209797e1f8fda4f1.png 1280w\"\n    data-zoom-src=\"/posts/uefn-parkour-maps-limitations/image.png\"\n    src=\"/posts/uefn-parkour-maps-limitations/image.png\"\n  /\u003e\n\n  \n\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 class=\"relative group\"\u003eWhy Parkour Paradise in Fortnite? \n    \u003cdiv id=\"why-parkour-paradise-in-fortnite\" class=\"anchor\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n    \n    \u003cspan\n        class=\"absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 ltr:-left-6 rtl:-right-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100\"\u003e\n        \u003ca class=\"group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700\"\n            style=\"text-decoration-line: none !important;\" href=\"#why-parkour-paradise-in-fortnite\" aria-label=\"Anchor\"\u003e#\u003c/a\u003e\n    \u003c/span\u003e        \n    \n\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure\u003e\n      \u003cimg\n    class=\"my-0 rounded-md\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"low\" alt=\"Parkour Paradise\"\n    srcset=\"\n      /posts/uefn-parkour-maps-limitations/ParkourParadise_hu_1f25ec082daff58d.png 330w,\n      /posts/uefn-parkour-maps-limitations/ParkourParadise_hu_64dd13acc145e468.png 660w,\n      /posts/uefn-parkour-maps-limitations/ParkourParadise_hu_536dc6ee0d54a7b1.png 1280w\"\n    data-zoom-src=\"/posts/uefn-parkour-maps-limitations/ParkourParadise.png\"\n    src=\"/posts/uefn-parkour-maps-limitations/ParkourParadise.png\"\n  /\u003e\n\n  \n\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Road to 100-Level Parkour Paradise in UEFN Nov 2024","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"15 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/uefn/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"UEFN","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"31 January 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/2d/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"2D","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"31 January 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/game-jam/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Game Jam","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"31 January 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/global-game-jam-2024/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Global Game Jam 2024","type":"tags"},{"content":" I trained Nicholas D for game designer roles, game programing by Steven W and George M, assets by Kevin Adi About the Game # Lore\u0026rsquo;s Quests is a simple and lighthearted 2D ragdoll physics game in which you play as a jester trying to entertain and pander to each and every whim of the King Lore-Lore in order to stay alive.

So let\u0026rsquo;s break it down what is Marvel Snap.\nMarvel Snap, developed by Second Dinner Studios and published by Nuverse, has emerged as a fast-paced collectible card game sensation. This review delves into the captivating world of Marvel Snap, where players construct superhero teams and engage in strategic battles across both PC and mobile platforms.\nOverview # Marvel Snap unfolds in the Marvel Universe, featuring beloved characters like Hulk, Spiderman, and Nightcrawler. Players, armed with their own decks, vie for supremacy in a game that spans just six turns, ensuring quick, action-packed gameplay.\nObjective # The primary goal is to secure two out of the three central locations on the game board by the final turn. Success hinges on outsmarting opponents and maximizing power at each location.\nGameplay # The simultaneous completion of turns injects excitement into every moment, making Marvel Snap an ideal on-the-go game, especially for mobile devices.\nCards # Each card in Marvel Snap has a Energy and Power value assigned to it. You start off by creating your deck with the cards available to you. Winning duels will reward you with credits and card boosters, which you can use to upgrade your card rarity.\nLocations # There are three locations in the center of the game board. Each location has a different effect that will help or hinder your strategy based on your card deck. The location will be revealed one by one every turn. So you have to adapt your strategy based on the location. There are over 140 locations in the game, so you have to be prepared for anything.\nSnap! # Snap is a mechanic that will be unlocked after you play the game for a while. It\u0026rsquo;s a special move that doubles your reward if you win the duel. But if you lose, you will lose double of your rewards too. So you have to be careful when using this feature. It\u0026rsquo;s apply to both player, so you can use this for psychological warfare.\nFun Factor # Previous Nextsads Why this game is so fun and addictive? Let\u0026rsquo;s break it down.\nSimple Gameplay # The rules, initially appearing complex, quickly become intuitive with an interactive tutorial, making Marvel Snap easy to learn and play. The game\u0026rsquo;s fast-paced nature, with each turn lasting only 30 seconds, ensures that players are constantly engaged. The game\u0026rsquo;s short duration also makes it ideal for mobile devices, allowing players to enjoy a quick game on the go.\nVisuals and Sound Effects # Stunning visuals exemplified in every unique card, contribute to a captivating gaming experience. The game\u0026rsquo;s vibrant colors and dynamic animations further enhance the visual appeal every turn you play or interact with the game. The music however, is a bit repetitive and could be improved, such as adding more tracks or allowing players to choose their own music, just like what Valve did on Counter-Strike 2. Unlike the music, the sound effects are well-designed and add to the overall experience. Especially the sound effects of the cards, which are unique to each card and are very satisfying to hear.\nCard Collection and Leveling System # Since Marvel Snap has a lot of cards, it\u0026rsquo;s make the game more dynamic and fun. You cannot expect what card your opponent will play next. So it feels like a gamble, but a fun gamble. The extensive card variety and leveling system, achievable through in-game currency or casual play, add dynamic and unpredictable elements to the game. Player could upgrade their cards to higher rarity, which won\u0026rsquo;t increase the power of the card, but will unlock new card animations and sound effects.\nRegular Updates and Active Community # Based on SteamDB accesed on January 2024, Marvel Snap has a very active playerbase and a great number of positive reviews. The game is also available on mobile devices, which further expands its playerbase. Frequent updates, including new cards, locations, cosmetics, and events, maintain Marvel Snap\u0026rsquo;s freshness. The active community on Discord and Reddit r/MarvelSnap further enhances the gaming experience.\nConclusion # Marvel Snap successfully combines unique mechanics with engaging content. As a free-to-play game, it strikes a balance between monetization and enjoyable gameplay. With its fast-paced, action-packed nature, Marvel Snap proves to be an ideal companion for gaming on the go.\n","date":"24 January 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/deconstruct-marvel-snap/","section":"Posts","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure\u003e\n      \u003cimg\n    class=\"my-0 rounded-md\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"low\" alt=\"Marvel Snap\"\n    srcset=\"\n      /posts/deconstruct-marvel-snap/_MARVELSNAPLOGO_hu_f4999334b1b9f8e6.png 330w,\n      /posts/deconstruct-marvel-snap/_MARVELSNAPLOGO_hu_94d8afd984f61764.png 660w,\n      /posts/deconstruct-marvel-snap/_MARVELSNAPLOGO_hu_f9ce2f1a35fa89aa.png 1280w\"\n    data-zoom-src=\"/posts/deconstruct-marvel-snap/_MARVELSNAPLOGO.png\"\n    src=\"/posts/deconstruct-marvel-snap/_MARVELSNAPLOGO.png\"\n  /\u003e\n\n  \n\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 class=\"relative group\"\u003eIntroduction \n    \u003cdiv id=\"introduction\" class=\"anchor\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n    \n    \u003cspan\n        class=\"absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 ltr:-left-6 rtl:-right-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100\"\u003e\n        \u003ca class=\"group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700\"\n            style=\"text-decoration-line: none !important;\" href=\"#introduction\" aria-label=\"Anchor\"\u003e#\u003c/a\u003e\n    \u003c/span\u003e        \n    \n\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s probably too late for me to deconstruct Marvel Snap since the game is classified as high end that take about 4gigs storage both mobile and desktop.

This time it\u0026rsquo;s Compfest 14. I formed a small team consist of 3 people. We decided to make a game about metroidvania. For 30 days of struggle sadly we didn\u0026rsquo;t make it through the final. But we still proud of our work and we try to do it better next time. Mainly i\u0026rsquo;m the one who did the game design, UI programming, and some of the art. Deka for the more complex programming such as the platformer physics, game mechanics, he also compose the music and draw the main character. Others is Zio for pixel artist and Azfa for additional programming and level design.\nHere is the clip of the game we made called May I Return that we made:\nGACCI 2022 # After Compfest 14, i decided to join another competition. This time it\u0026rsquo;s GACCI 2022. Another competition show up, this time it\u0026rsquo;s a competition held by Binus University. This competition is a bit different from the previous one. This time we have to make a game design document(which i never did before), so i eager to learn what is game design document. I got into the final and some of my friends from AGI Competition also get into the final. We have to do sort of game pitching for the jury. I got the 1st place and my friends got the 2nd place. Apparently i made it to the final because of my game design document is the longest and the most complex one. I tried to make a fusion game of Papers Please and Cooking Mama on Indonesian Independence Day theme. The prize is a fullscholarship for Binus University.\nGIM JAM ITB 2023 # It\u0026rsquo;s a 7 days game jam basicly, with the theme of \u0026ldquo;Meme Indonesia\u0026rdquo;. I made a game about Meth, Magician, and Latto-latto. Because meme is vary, i decided to put 3 meme in one game. I made it to become the Winner of Best Game Award. I made this game with Deka, Zio. We made this game using kinematic skeleton to animate the character, it\u0026rsquo;s save a lot of time.\nGlobal Game Jam 2023 # It\u0026rsquo;s a 48 hours offline game jam with \u0026ldquo;Root\u0026rdquo; as a theme. The event supported by GameLan.YK, I made the level design based on the Team Lead direction and searched for some audio assets for the game. I met a lot of new people and had a lot of fun, we got a visit from Kementerian Pariwisata dan Ekonomi Kreatif, Muhammad Neil El Himam and Sandiaga Uno.\nHere is the clip of the game we made called Stay Hydrated! that we made:\nand here is the recap of the event:\nTono # My experiment for 3D game, probably my shamest work. I made this game for Vocachamp 2023. Made with the new Godot Engine 4, 3D assets with Blender, audio with BeepBox, drawing with Krita, video editing software with KDEnLive. I made a Hamster Ball game like. Beside my shamest work i also proud of this work because i made it all by myself. I made the 3D assets, the music, the sound effect, the game design, the programming, the level design, the UI, the video editing, and the game trailer. I made this game in 2 weeks.\n","date":"1 January 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/school-chaos/","section":"Posts","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI made this blog for my past project that i do when i was on highschool.\n\u003ch1 id=\"typeit-ddaf1096996a15f40134186e45fab7aa\"\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\n\n\u003cscript\u003e\n    document.addEventListener(\"DOMContentLoaded\", function () {\n      new TypeIt(\"#typeit-ddaf1096996a15f40134186e45fab7aa\", {\n        strings: [\"\",\"    This is where it all begins...\",\"\"],\n        speed:  100 ,\n        lifeLike:  true ,\n        startDelay:  100 ,\n        breakLines:  false ,\n        waitUntilVisible:  true ,\n        loop:  false \n      }).go();\n    });\n\u003c/script\u003e\u003c/p\u003e","title":"My Highschool Game Project","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"1 January 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/school/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"School","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"28 December 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/blog/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Blog","type":"tags"},{"content":"This is my first post for my blog.
