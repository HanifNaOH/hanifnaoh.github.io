Players take on the role of a colony leader tasked with building and expanding their settlement while managing resources and overcoming challenges. The game combines strategic deck-building mechanics with resource management and exploration elements, offering players a unique and engaging gameplay experience.\nResponsibilities # Game Designer: I designed core gameplay systems, including the deck-building mechanics, resource management, and colony expansion features. I created detailed design documents and balanced game mechanics to ensure engaging and strategic gameplay. I currently try to add more content and features based on player feedback so it will be enjoyable for player to play.\nGame Programmer: I implemented some SDK and QA for the game so it will be scalable for mobile and PC cross-platform play. I worked with integrating Epic Online Services for scalable functionality and leaderboards. Also optimized game performance and fixed bugs to ensure a smooth player experience. UI Designer: I designed the Mock up for the UI, including menus, HUD, and in-game interfaces. I created wireframes and prototypes to visualize the user experience and collaborated with developers to implement the designs effectively. Imo, im still learning more about UI/UX design to make it better in the future, it\u0026rsquo;s my biggest issue here.\nCore Loop # Build Facilities Manage Resources Play Cards Expand Colony Gameplay # Deck Management # Players build and customize their decks by acquiring new cards through gameplay, allowing for strategic variety and adaptability. I learn Roguelike + RnG mechanics to make the game more interesting.\nResource Management # Players must efficiently manage resources such as Tech, Social, and Diplomatic to ensure the survival and growth of their colony. The resource system is designed as cost resources to spend the cards.\nColony Expansion # Players expand their colony by constructing new facilities and exploring the alien planet. Expansion unlocks new opportunities and challenges, requiring strategic planning and resource allocation.\nPlayer Feedback # Players love the art direction and the unique blend of deck-building and colony management mechanics. Many Players struggling on learning the tutorial which will be improved in future updates. Some players have suggested improvements to the user interface and additional content to enhance the overall experience.\nAudiences # Card game enthusiasts, strategy game players, and fans of colony management simulations.\nResults # Its for competition for Mage XII and we won 1st gold, however the game is still in development and will be released in Q2 2026. The game has received positive feedback from playtesters and negative feedback about UX, with many praising its unique mechanics and engaging gameplay but hard to learn tutorial.\nAdd More Card variants and improve UX especially on tutorial and onboarding experience. Optimize performance for mobile devices. Implement EoS features for cross-platform play and leaderboards. Implement EoS features for Title Storage, Player Storage, and Achievements.

So, i create a standard according my experience leading some artists. This also based on SKKNI (Standar Kompetensi Kerja Nasional Indonesia) which is a national standard for work competencies in Indonesia in 2024. This article created for GameSeed 2025, a game development event in Indonesia.\nRoadmap # Art Basics # You are game artist and you have to know the basics of art. This is the foundation of your work. You should be able to create basic shapes, understand color theory, and have a good grasp of perspective.\nAnatomy/Figure # WIP\nColor, Lighting, and Shading # WIP\nTools and Software # WIP\nPractice, Applied, and Feedback # Practice, applied on the game project, and feedback are crucial for your growth as a game artist. You should be able to apply what you learn in real projects and get feedback from your peers and mentors.\nSome of the forms of Game Art is not limited to:\nConcept Art # Seems easy, but its hard to master. Because most of the time you trace the concept art from other artists, and you have to create your own style. You should be able to create concept art for characters, environments, and props. Dont be like an AI that just blatantly copy and paste(it\u0026rsquo;s not wrong tho). Here is example of Space for The Unbound Artbook and Super Mario Odyssey Artbook.\nCharacter # Okay, now you have the character concept, now draw it, and put it in the game. Here is example of Space for The Unbound Artbook. You should be able to create characters that fit in the game. This includes designing their appearance, vibes, until the story. As you can see, each character has its own unique style and personality, which is reflected in their design and pose.\nEnvironment and Level # Okay, you may need to be architecture lover, this is the most important part of the game. You should be able to create worlds that fit the game\u0026rsquo;s style and theme. This includes designing the layout, props, and atmosphere of the environment that may fit, discuss with Game Designer what the environment needs (mostly so we game designer could reuse the assets and make it efficient).\nAnimation # Cool drawing, lets animate it, how much time does it take? This includes character animations, environment animations, and sometimes UI animations. Make sure the quality of the animation is good and fits the game\u0026rsquo;s style and consistent. Dont forget the burden of 12 Principles of Animation.\nUI/UX Design # Typography, color, and layout are important in UI/UX design. You should be able to create user interfaces that are easy to use and fit the game\u0026rsquo;s style. This includes designing menus, buttons, and other UI elements that enhance the player\u0026rsquo;s experience. It includes from paper to implementation, which sometimes requires VFX and heavy animations, and lot of attention to detail.\nI recomend you to see Game UI DB for references. What kind of texture, what kind of color, what kind of layout, and what kind of typography that fits the game.\nFor the output format, see Kenney for the output examples. They provide the minimum requirements for the UI/UX design, which is very easy for game programmers to implement. For more advance thing here is accesibility requirements, you can see Game Accessibility Guidelines.\nfor future me https://www.imgchest.com/p/ej7ml5onb4d\n","date":"13 July 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/game-artist-2025/","section":"Posts","summary":"\u003ch2 class=\"relative group\"\u003eIntroduction \n    \u003cdiv id=\"introduction\" class=\"anchor\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n    \n    \u003cspan\n        class=\"absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100 select-none\"\u003e\n        \u003ca class=\"group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700 !no-underline\" href=\"#introduction\" aria-label=\"Anchor\"\u003e#\u003c/a\u003e\n    \u003c/span\u003e        \n    \n\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the ever-evolving landscape of game development, the role of a game artist is becoming increasingly demanding, even after the rise of AI which may discourage some people.

This article aims to provide a roadmap for aspiring game programmers in 2025, focusing on essential skills and practices that will help them thrive in the industry.\nGame Programming Patterns # Okay, I build a lot of systems, but systems have always been patterns. Recognizing and understanding these patterns is crucial for any game developer. Common patterns include the Entity-Component-System (ECS) architecture, state machines, and event-driven programming. Familiarity with these patterns will enable you to design more efficient and maintainable code. So you could thank for your past self for learning these patterns and apply it in your game project. See more Game Programming Patterns or watch it on YT for more insights.\nStrong STEM Skills # A game programmer must have a basic skillset in STEM(Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics). This includes a solid understanding of algorithms, data structures, and mathematics. You should be able to apply these concepts to solve complex problems in game development, for example Physics Manipulation and problem solving, highly recommend at least understand Dynamic Programming.\nGame AI # Game AI is a crucial aspect of modern game development. You should be familiar with various AI techniques, including pathfinding, decision trees, behavior trees, state machine, and Goal Action Planning. Understanding how to implement AI systems that can adapt to player actions and provide a challenging experience is essential. Familiarity with machine learning concepts can also be beneficial, as more games are incorporating AI-driven features make the AI more human like, the recent advancement is using OpenAI Key as NPC where you could talk realtime.\nFrontEnd # Okay this is basicly the Game Engine, you should be familiar with game engines like Unity, Unreal Engine, Godot. Understanding how to create and manage game objects, scenes, and assets is essential. You should also be able to implement game mechanics, physics, and animations using the engine\u0026rsquo;s scripting language. Familiarity with game engine architecture, including rendering pipelines and input systems, will help you create more efficient and optimized games.\nBackEnd # Where do player data stored? At the backend, of course. You should be familiar with server-side programming languages like Node.js, Python, or Java. Understanding how to create and manage databases is also essential such as SQL based, as player data needs to be stored securely and efficiently. Familiarity with RESTful APIs and web services will help you integrate your game with online features. Server management, including deployment and scaling, is also a crucial skill for game programmers. Since it online, you have to learn networking concepts, including protocols, latency, and bandwidth management. Understanding how to optimize network performance is essential for creating smooth multiplayer experiences.\nGame Graphics # Shaders, rendering techniques, and optimization are crucial for creating visually stunning games. You should be familiar with graphics APIs like OpenGL, DirectX, or Vulkan, and understand how to implement shaders to achieve various visual effects. You have to understand the basics of vertex and fragment shaders, and how they interact with the graphics pipeline. Familiarity with tools like Unity with their shader graph or Unreal Engine with MaterialShader can also be beneficial, as they provide powerful graphics capabilities out of the box.\nKISS, DRY, and SOLID Principles # Okay dont be over do it without testing it, dont ever push untested code to production or even to the main branch. Always test your code before deploying it. This will help you catch bugs and issues early, and ensure that your code is stable and reliable.\nKISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) means should be simple and straightforward. Avoid unnecessary complexity in your code.\nDRY (Don\u0026rsquo;t Repeat Yourself) use plugins or built-in functions, reusable components, and libraries to avoid redundancy. This will make your code more maintainable and easier to read.\nSOLID principles are a set of design principles that help you create more maintainable and scalable code(especially if its teamworks). These principles include:\nSingle Responsibility Principle (SRP): A class should have only one reason to change. Open/Closed Principle (OCP): Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP): Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP): Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP): High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.

The game is built around a series of interconnected systems that allow players to manage resources, automate tasks, and progress through a farming simulation. (Quality of life not included in this breakdown lol)\nGame Core Loop # flowchart LR A[Growing Crop] --\u003e B[Progression] B[Progression] --\u003e C[Idle Waiting] C[Idle Waiting] --\u003e A[Growing Crop] For non-programmers, the core loop of the game can be summarized as follows:\nStart the game and let crops grow idly. Check if any crops are mature for harvesting. If yes, harvest the crops and collect resources. Allocate resources either to reinvest in the farm or hold for later. Decide whether to buy upgrades or hire new helpers. Repeat the loop. Aesthetics # User Interface # The user interface of Rusty’s Retirement is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly. Art Style # The Game height is around 320px, which is a common resolution for pixel art games. This resolution allows for detailed pixel art while maintaining a nostalgic aesthetic. The game’s visuals are charming and contribute to the overall relaxing atmosphere, making it visually appealing to players who enjoy pixel art games.\nSound Design # Chilling and relaxing music. If you have any idea what type of music this is, please let me know. But for me its just chill.\nFor the SFX, there is not much since the game intent to not distract you while you are doing other tasks. The game has a few sound effects for actions like planting, harvesting, and watering crops, but they are subtle and not intrusive.\nProgression and Replayability # Building \u0026amp; NPCs # You can build various structures and hire NPCs to help automate tasks. Some NPCs has unique abilities that can help you progress faster, or provide unique benefits such as decoration or new resources\nNew Crops # Well, bored of the same crops? You can unlock new crops by progressing through the game and completing certain tasks. Each crop has its own growth time, yield, and resource value, adding variety to your farming experience.\nStats View # I forgot which NPC that unlock this, but you can view your stats and progress in the game. This feature allows you to track your achievements, resources collected, and overall farm performance.

You can also script in C#, C++, or VisualScript. Its MIT license means zero royalties or subscriptions.\nUnity # Unity supports both 2D and 3D out of the box, with a primary C# API and a massive Asset Store full of plugins, templates, and art assets. Three render pipelines (URP and HDRP) cover everything from mobile to high-end PC (However, I find it difficult to work around).\nUnreal # Unreal Engine (latest UE5) shines in photorealism thanks to Nanite (virtualized geometry) and Lumen (dynamic global illumination and reflections). Blueprint visual scripting complements its C++ core, giving you AAA-grade tools from day one, so no need to reinvent the wheel. I would like to try it out again later this year.\nPerformance # Godot excels in 2D, offering lightweight runtime assemblies and sub-millisecond frame times even on modest hardware. Its 3D capabilities have improved dramatically in 4.x but still lag behind the giants in extremely complex scenes. Unity performs well across platforms but can incur overhead in heavy HDRP scenes or when loading large asset bundles. Profiling and manual optimizations are often required for top-tier performance. Unreal delivers unrivalled fidelity and Nanite can stream billions of triangles without hiccups, and Lumen brings real-time GI to life, provided you have a high-end GPU(but you need to know the basic of baking or you will sacrifice the performance a lot on the user). Community \u0026amp; Ecosystem # Godot has a passionate open-source community, with rapid iteration on features and a growing plugin repository, though its third-party asset library remains smaller, but I\u0026rsquo;ve seen it growing that Unity assets start supporting Godot and Unreal. Unity boasts the largest developer base, extensive documentation, tutorials, and an Asset Store that can save weeks of work—at the expense of subscription fees for larger teams. However, Unity 6 has been criticized for its lack of innovation in recent years, with many developers feeling it has stagnated compared to Godot and Unreal. There is recent CTO shuffle which has left many in the community wondering about the future direction of Unity. Unreal offers a robust Marketplace and deep integration with Quixel Megascans. Documentation and sample projects are extensive, but the engine’s complexity can intimidate beginners. Its been use in film and AAA games for years, so you can find a wealth of resources, it feels like a factory with everything you need to build a game, but it can be overwhelming for new users. When to Choose Which # Godot as your Swiss Army knife: Need rapid prototyping, 2D games, or tooling? Godot lets you move fast without licensing headaches. Unity 6 is lacking: Despite broad support and a mature pipeline, Unity 6 still hasn’t closed the gap on Godot’s 2D workflow or matched Unreal’s plug-and-play AAA features, making it feel less compelling as a true all-rounder. Unreal for indie AAA polish: Small teams chasing console-quality visuals, advanced physics, or large-scale worlds will find Unreal’s toolset unrivalled, if they can handle the learning curve and hardware demands(like at least a mid-range GPU, my 3000 series laptop is caught lacking). Conclusion # Each engine has its sweet spot. Godot offers speed, flexibility, and zero cost which is ideal for indies and rapid prototyping. Unity remains a solid generalist with vast community resources, for students a lot of studios are still using Unity, but faces growing competition with Godot and Unreal, especially for AAA. Unreal stands alone for cutting-edge visuals and scale, making it the go-to for indies who want AAA without building a custom engine.\nPersonally I picked Godot for my next project because it aligns with my need for rapid iteration, lightweight, and ease of use, especially in 2D. However, I’m excited to explore Unreal for future projects that demand high-end graphics and complex interactions.\n","date":"5 June 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/godot-vs-unity-unreal/","section":"Posts","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn this post, I compare Godot, Unity, and Unreal Engine across features, performance, and community support to help you choose the right engine for your next project.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 class=\"relative group\"\u003eFeatures \n    \u003cdiv id=\"features\" class=\"anchor\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n    \n    \u003cspan\n        class=\"absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100 select-none\"\u003e\n        \u003ca class=\"group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700 !no-underline\" href=\"#features\" aria-label=\"Anchor\"\u003e#\u003c/a\u003e\n    \u003c/span\u003e        \n    \n\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 class=\"relative group\"\u003eGodot \n    \u003cdiv id=\"godot\" class=\"anchor\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n    \n    \u003cspan\n        class=\"absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100 select-none\"\u003e\n        \u003ca class=\"group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700 !no-underline\" href=\"#godot\" aria-label=\"Anchor\"\u003e#\u003c/a\u003e\n    \u003c/span\u003e        \n    \n\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure\u003e\n      \u003cimg\n    class=\"my-0 rounded-md\"\n    loading=\"lazy\"\n    decoding=\"async\"\n    fetchpriority=\"low\"\n    alt=\"godot\"\n    srcset=\"\n      /posts/godot-vs-unity-unreal/godot_hu_9108ed7a1c86235a.png  330w,\n      /posts/godot-vs-unity-unreal/godot_hu_306af4e69f5a17e5.png  660w,\n      /posts/godot-vs-unity-unreal/godot_hu_ec79f0964b60e1bc.png 1280w\n    \"\n    data-zoom-src=\"/posts/godot-vs-unity-unreal/godot.png\"\n    src=\"/posts/godot-vs-unity-unreal/godot.png\"\u003e\n\n  \n\u003c/figure\u003e\n\nGodot’s node-based scene system and integrated GDScript make it incredibly approachable.

I\u0026rsquo;ll discuss the unique challenges and advantages we encountered during development, as well as how each approach impacted player engagement and immersion.\nWhats the Difference? # THE MATH behind 2D and 3D games is fundamentally different. In a 2D game, the world is flat, and all interactions occur on a single plane(x and y). This simplicity allows for easier asset creation and faster development cycles. However, it can limit the depth of immersion and spatial interaction. Howevery you could use parallax scrolling to create a sense of depth, but it still lacks the full 3D experience. So it\u0026rsquo;s just depth illusion.\nIn contrast, 3D games operate in a three-dimensional space (x, y, and z), allowing for more complex interactions and a greater sense of immersion. The math behind 3D games involves transformations, projections, and lighting calculations, which can be more challenging to implement but result in a richer player experience.\nDevelopment Challenges # 2D Horror Game # The 2D horror game we developed had its own set of challenges. Creating a compelling atmosphere with limited visual depth required us to focus heavily on art style, sound design, and narrative. We used 2D lighting techniques to evoke a sense of nostalgia while incorporating eerie soundscapes to enhance the horror elements.\n3D Horror Game # The 3D horror game presented a different set of challenges. The complexity of 3D modeling, animation, and physics required a more robust development pipeline. We had to consider camera angles, lighting effects, and spatial audio to create an immersive environment. The increased detail in graphics allowed for more realistic scares, but it also demanded more resources and time.\nWhats the similarities? # Both 2D and 3D horror games share common elements that contribute to the horror experience. These include:\nAtmosphere: Both types of games rely on creating a tense and unsettling atmosphere through visuals, sound, and narrative. Storytelling: Engaging narratives are crucial in both formats to keep players invested and heighten the horror experience. Like why the player is in this situation, and what is the backstory of the horror. Gameplay Mechanics: Core gameplay mechanics, such as exploration, puzzle-solving, and survival elements, can be found in both 2D and 3D horror games. These mechanics are essential for player engagement and immersion. however, the implementation may differ due to the dimensionality of the game. Pacing: Effective pacing is essential in both formats to build tension and deliver scares at the right moments. Since you don\u0026rsquo;t want to overwhelm the player with too many scares at once, or too little jumpscare, you need to balance the pacing of the game. Environmental Storytelling: Both formats can use the environment to tell a story, revealing lore and backstory through visual elements and interactions. This in my opinion is the most important part of a horror game, because it can make the player feel like they are in a real world, and the horror is happening in that world.

Containers package an application and its dependencies together, ensuring that it runs consistently across different environments. This is particularly useful for game servers like Minecraft, where you want to ensure a stable and reproducible environment for players.\nWhy Use Docker for Minecraft? # Using Docker for a Minecraft server has several advantages:\nPortability: Easily move your server between different machines or cloud providers. Isolation: Each server runs in its own container, preventing conflicts with other applications. Scalability: Quickly scale your server up or down based on player demand. Consistency: Ensure that the server runs the same way in development, testing, and production environments.

Fortnite’s UEFN finally lets us script, model, and publish our own islands with almost the same freedom as a standalone Unreal project—so I’m building a 100-level gauntlet that feels familiar to Minecraft veterans yet leverages Fortnite movement (mantle, slide, sprint) and visuals.\nHigh-Level Design # Goal Details 100 distinct checkpoints Each level lasts 10–40 seconds for an average player. Rising difficulty curve Every 10 levels introduces a new mechanic (e.g., air vents, moving platforms, slide-jumps). No dead-ends Miss a jump? Fall zones funnel players to the last checkpoint—no lengthy back-tracking. Speedrun friendly Integrated timer, gold/silver/bronze splits, and leaderboard widget. I’m blocking out levels in groups of 10 to iterate faster, then art-pass once the movement feels right.\nTools \u0026amp; Workflow # Grey-box in UEFN with simple shapes and the ParkourCheckDevice (custom Verse script storing progress). Playtest locally with friends via private code; gather heat-map data on where players fall. Art pass in chunks: replace primitives with stylised geometry, enable Lumen for soft lighting, and sprinkle VFX. Performance sweep on Switch and last-gen consoles; trim materials or swap meshes as needed. Push to Creative Sandbox for public playtest → collect analytics → repeat. Current UEFN Pain Points (May 2025) # Limitation Impact on a 100-Level Parkour Map Practical Work-around Rapid, unstable feature updates Weekly client patches can change the editor UI or Verse APIs overnight, forcing unplanned re-builds. Keep a frozen branch in source control; wait 48 h after each release before upgrading your main dev build. Updates sometimes break working content Projects that opened fine yesterday may throw Verse compile errors or fail to load checkpoints after a hot-fix. Pin every milestone to a tagged Git commit; test new versions in a scratch copy and roll back if critical devices fail. Metaverse-first roadmap Epic’s priority list skews toward big, shared world features—smaller QoL requests (e.g., finer timer controls) slide down the queue. Track the Trello roadmap and design levels around what already exists; up-vote community tickets to raise visibility. Less-diverse player base than Roblox Fortnite’s audience is ~60 % ages 18–24, whereas Roblox remains majority under-16; feedback may tilt toward shooter veterans, not younger casuals. Recruit broader testers via Discord servers, TikTok, and school esports clubs; consider cross-posting demos on Roblox to reach younger players. High-end PC strongly recommended UEFN editing is sluggish on laptops without a discrete GPU and \u0026lt;16 GB RAM, slowing iteration on large obstacle courses. Develop on a desktop with ≥16 GB RAM + mid-range GPU, or stream UEFN remotely from a cloud workstation; keep grey-box assets lightweight until final art pass. Progress Snapshot (Update November 15, 2024) # Levels completed: 30/100 playable Art-pass finished: 1-10 are proven cool Average clear time: 6 min 12 s (internal test) Most-failed jump: Level 8 triple corner jump (32 % fail rate) Bugs: Vent momentum boost sometimes stacks (investigating) Next Steps # Finish grey-box for levels 40–60 (introduce ice slide mechanic). Polish existing timer UI and integrate global leaderboard service. Record a teaser clip for TikTok/X (target 30 s vertical). Reach out to the Parkour Paradise creator for a friendly shout-out once we’re near beta. Get Involved # Playtest: Want early access? DM me on Bsky for a private island code. Feedback: Join the Discord and drop your checkpoint completion times. Collab: 3D artists or Verse scripters looking for a side project are welcome, let’s polish this to a shine! Stay tuned for the next dev-blog covering ice mechanics and the first public stress test. 🚀\n","date":"15 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/uefn-parkour-maps-limitations/","section":"Posts","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure\u003e\n      \u003cimg\n    class=\"my-0 rounded-md\"\n    loading=\"lazy\"\n    decoding=\"async\"\n    fetchpriority=\"low\"\n    alt=\"UEFN\"\n    srcset=\"\n      /posts/uefn-parkour-maps-limitations/image-frot_hu_68454c566f37e394.png  330w,\n      /posts/uefn-parkour-maps-limitations/image-frot_hu_ea46941e30d1a36e.png  660w,\n      /posts/uefn-parkour-maps-limitations/image-frot_hu_209797e1f8fda4f1.png 1280w\n    \"\n    data-zoom-src=\"/posts/uefn-parkour-maps-limitations/image-frot.png\"\n    src=\"/posts/uefn-parkour-maps-limitations/image-frot.png\"\u003e\n\n  \n\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 class=\"relative group\"\u003eWhy Parkour Paradise in Fortnite? \n    \u003cdiv id=\"why-parkour-paradise-in-fortnite\" class=\"anchor\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n    \n    \u003cspan\n        class=\"absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100 select-none\"\u003e\n        \u003ca class=\"group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700 !no-underline\" href=\"#why-parkour-paradise-in-fortnite\" aria-label=\"Anchor\"\u003e#\u003c/a\u003e\n    \u003c/span\u003e        \n    \n\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure\u003e\n      \u003cimg\n    class=\"my-0 rounded-md\"\n    loading=\"lazy\"\n    decoding=\"async\"\n    fetchpriority=\"low\"\n    alt=\"Parkour Paradise\"\n    srcset=\"\n      /posts/uefn-parkour-maps-limitations/ParkourParadise_hu_1f25ec082daff58d.png  330w,\n      /posts/uefn-parkour-maps-limitations/ParkourParadise_hu_64dd13acc145e468.png  660w,\n      /posts/uefn-parkour-maps-limitations/ParkourParadise_hu_536dc6ee0d54a7b1.png 1280w\n    \"\n    data-zoom-src=\"/posts/uefn-parkour-maps-limitations/ParkourParadise.png\"\n    src=\"/posts/uefn-parkour-maps-limitations/ParkourParadise.png\"\u003e\n\n  \n\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Road to 100-Level Parkour Paradise in UEFN Nov 2024","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"31 January 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/2d/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"2D","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"31 January 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/game-jam/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Game Jam","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"31 January 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/global-game-jam-2024/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Global Game Jam 2024","type":"tags"},{"content":" I trained Nicholas D for game designer roles, game programing by Steven W and George M, assets by Kevin Adi About the Game # Lore\u0026rsquo;s Quests is a simple and lighthearted 2D ragdoll physics game in which you play as a jester trying to entertain and pander to each and every whim of the King Lore-Lore in order to stay alive.

So let\u0026rsquo;s break it down what is Marvel Snap.\nMarvel Snap, developed by Second Dinner Studios and published by Nuverse, has emerged as a fast-paced collectible card game sensation. This review delves into the captivating world of Marvel Snap, where players construct superhero teams and engage in strategic battles across both PC and mobile platforms.\nOverview # Marvel Snap unfolds in the Marvel Universe, featuring beloved characters like Hulk, Spiderman, and Nightcrawler. Players, armed with their own decks, vie for supremacy in a game that spans just six turns, ensuring quick, action-packed gameplay.\nObjective # The primary goal is to secure two out of the three central locations on the game board by the final turn. Success hinges on outsmarting opponents and maximizing power at each location.\nGameplay # The simultaneous completion of turns injects excitement into every moment, making Marvel Snap an ideal on-the-go game, especially for mobile devices.\nCards # Each card in Marvel Snap has a Energy and Power value assigned to it. You start off by creating your deck with the cards available to you. Winning duels will reward you with credits and card boosters, which you can use to upgrade your card rarity.\nLocations # There are three locations in the center of the game board. Each location has a different effect that will help or hinder your strategy based on your card deck. The location will be revealed one by one every turn. So you have to adapt your strategy based on the location. There are over 140 locations in the game, so you have to be prepared for anything.\nSnap! # Snap is a mechanic that will be unlocked after you play the game for a while. It\u0026rsquo;s a special move that doubles your reward if you win the duel. But if you lose, you will lose double of your rewards too. So you have to be careful when using this feature. It\u0026rsquo;s apply to both player, so you can use this for psychological warfare.\nFun Factor # Previous Next Why this game is so fun and addictive? Let\u0026rsquo;s break it down.\nSimple Gameplay # The rules, initially appearing complex, quickly become intuitive with an interactive tutorial, making Marvel Snap easy to learn and play. The game\u0026rsquo;s fast-paced nature, with each turn lasting only 30 seconds, ensures that players are constantly engaged. The game\u0026rsquo;s short duration also makes it ideal for mobile devices, allowing players to enjoy a quick game on the go.\nVisuals and Sound Effects # Stunning visuals exemplified in every unique card, contribute to a captivating gaming experience. The game\u0026rsquo;s vibrant colors and dynamic animations further enhance the visual appeal every turn you play or interact with the game. The music however, is a bit repetitive and could be improved, such as adding more tracks or allowing players to choose their own music, just like what Valve did on Counter-Strike 2. Unlike the music, the sound effects are well-designed and add to the overall experience. Especially the sound effects of the cards, which are unique to each card and are very satisfying to hear.\nCard Collection and Leveling System # Since Marvel Snap has a lot of cards, it\u0026rsquo;s make the game more dynamic and fun. You cannot expect what card your opponent will play next. So it feels like a gamble, but a fun gamble. The extensive card variety and leveling system, achievable through in-game currency or casual play, add dynamic and unpredictable elements to the game. Player could upgrade their cards to higher rarity, which won\u0026rsquo;t increase the power of the card, but will unlock new card animations and sound effects.\nRegular Updates and Active Community # Based on SteamDB accesed on January 2024, Marvel Snap has a very active playerbase and a great number of positive reviews. The game is also available on mobile devices, which further expands its playerbase. Frequent updates, including new cards, locations, cosmetics, and events, maintain Marvel Snap\u0026rsquo;s freshness. The active community on Discord and Reddit r/MarvelSnap further enhances the gaming experience.\nConclusion # Marvel Snap successfully combines unique mechanics with engaging content. As a free-to-play game, it strikes a balance between monetization and enjoyable gameplay. With its fast-paced, action-packed nature, Marvel Snap proves to be an ideal companion for gaming on the go.\n","date":"24 January 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/deconstruct-marvel-snap/","section":"Posts","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure\u003e\n      \u003cimg\n    class=\"my-0 rounded-md\"\n    loading=\"lazy\"\n    decoding=\"async\"\n    fetchpriority=\"low\"\n    alt=\"Marvel Snap\"\n    srcset=\"\n      /posts/deconstruct-marvel-snap/_MARVELSNAPLOGO_hu_f4999334b1b9f8e6.png  330w,\n      /posts/deconstruct-marvel-snap/_MARVELSNAPLOGO_hu_94d8afd984f61764.png  660w,\n      /posts/deconstruct-marvel-snap/_MARVELSNAPLOGO_hu_f9ce2f1a35fa89aa.png 1280w\n    \"\n    data-zoom-src=\"/posts/deconstruct-marvel-snap/_MARVELSNAPLOGO.png\"\n    src=\"/posts/deconstruct-marvel-snap/_MARVELSNAPLOGO.png\"\u003e\n\n  \n\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 class=\"relative group\"\u003eIntroduction \n    \u003cdiv id=\"introduction\" class=\"anchor\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n    \n    \u003cspan\n        class=\"absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100 select-none\"\u003e\n        \u003ca class=\"group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700 !no-underline\" href=\"#introduction\" aria-label=\"Anchor\"\u003e#\u003c/a\u003e\n    \u003c/span\u003e        \n    \n\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s probably too late for me to deconstruct Marvel Snap since the game is classified as high end that take about 4gigs storage both mobile and desktop.

This time it\u0026rsquo;s GACCI 2022. Another competition show up, this time it\u0026rsquo;s a competition held by Binus University. This competition is a bit different from the previous one. This time we have to make a game design document(which i never did before), so i eager to learn what is game design document. I got into the final and some of my friends from AGI Competition also get into the final. We have to do sort of game pitching for the jury. I got the 1st place and my friends got the 2nd place. Apparently i made it to the final because of my game design document is the longest and the most complex one. I tried to make a fusion game of Papers Please and Cooking Mama on Indonesian Independence Day theme. The prize is a fullscholarship for Binus University.\nGIM JAM ITB 2023 # It\u0026rsquo;s a 7 days game jam basicly, with the theme of \u0026ldquo;Meme Indonesia\u0026rdquo;. I made a game about Meth, Magician, and Latto-latto. Because meme is vary, i decided to put 3 meme in one game. I made it to become the Winner of Best Game Award. I made this game with Deka, Zio. We made this game using kinematic skeleton to animate the character, it\u0026rsquo;s save a lot of time.\nGlobal Game Jam 2023 # It\u0026rsquo;s a 48 hours offline game jam with \u0026ldquo;Root\u0026rdquo; as a theme. The event supported by GameLan.YK, I made the level design based on the Team Lead direction and searched for some audio assets for the game. I met a lot of new people and had a lot of fun, we got a visit from Kementerian Pariwisata dan Ekonomi Kreatif, Muhammad Neil El Himam and Sandiaga Uno.\nHere is the clip of the game we made called Stay Hydrated! that we made:\nand here is the recap of the event:\nTono # My experiment for 3D game, probably my shamest work. I made this game for Vocachamp 2023. Made with the new Godot Engine 4, 3D assets with Blender, audio with BeepBox, drawing with Krita, video editing software with KDEnLive. I made a Hamster Ball game like. Beside my shamest work i also proud of this work because i made it all by myself. I made the 3D assets, the music, the sound effect, the game design, the programming, the level design, the UI, the video editing, and the game trailer. I made this game in 2 weeks.\n","date":"1 January 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/school-chaos/","section":"Posts","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI made this blog for my past project that i do when i was on highschool.\n\u003ch1 id=\"typeit-ddaf1096996a15f40134186e45fab7aa\"\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\n\n\u003cscript\u003e\n    document.addEventListener(\"DOMContentLoaded\", function () {\n      new TypeIt(\"#typeit-ddaf1096996a15f40134186e45fab7aa\", {\n        strings: [\"\",\"    This is where it all begins...\",\"\"],\n        speed:  100 ,\n        lifeLike:  true ,\n        startDelay:  100 ,\n        breakLines:  false ,\n        waitUntilVisible:  true ,\n        loop:  false \n      }).go();\n    });\n\u003c/script\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e","title":"My Highschool Game Project","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"1 January 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/school/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"School","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"28 December 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/blog/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Blog","type":"tags"},{"content":"This is my first post for my blog.
