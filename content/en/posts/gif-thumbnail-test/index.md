# GIF Thumbnail Test Post

This is a test post to verify that GIF thumbnails work correctly in the Blowfish theme.

The post should display an animated GIF as its thumbnail in:
- Homepage article cards
- Post listing pages
- Social media sharing (Open Graph)

## Test Details

- **Theme**: Blowfish
- **Image Processing**: Currently set to `disableImageOptimization = false`
- **Expected Behavior**: GIF should appear as thumbnail but may lose animation due to processing
- **File Name**: `featured.gif` (following Blowfish naming convention)

## Content

This is just test content to fill out the post. The important part is whether the GIF thumbnail displays correctly in the various layouts.
