## About

Planet of Mei is a colony management deck-building strategy game set on an alien planet. Players take on the role of a colony leader tasked with building and expanding their settlement while managing resources and overcoming challenges. The game combines strategic deck-building mechanics with resource management and exploration elements, offering players a unique and engaging gameplay experience.

## Responsibilities

**Game Designer**: I designed core gameplay systems, including the deck-building mechanics, resource management, and colony expansion features. I created detailed design documents and balanced game mechanics to ensure engaging and strategic gameplay. I currently try to add more content and features based on player feedback so it will be enjoyable for player to play.

**Game Programmer**: I implemented some SDK and QA for the game so it will be scalable for mobile and PC cross-platform play. I worked with integrating Epic Online Services for scalable functionality and leaderboards. Also optimized game performance and fixed bugs to ensure a smooth player experience.
**UI Designer**: I designed the Mock up for the UI, including menus, HUD, and in-game interfaces. I created wireframes and prototypes to visualize the user experience and collaborated with developers to implement the designs effectively. Imo, im still learning more about UI/UX design to make it better in the future, it's my biggest issue here.

## Core Loop

1. Build Facilities
2. Manage Resources
3. Play Cards
4. Expand Colony

## Gameplay

### Deck Management

Players build and customize their decks by acquiring new cards through gameplay, allowing for strategic variety and adaptability. I learn Roguelike + RnG mechanics to make the game more interesting.

### Resource Management

Players must efficiently manage resources such as Tech, Social, and Diplomatic to ensure the survival and growth of their colony. The resource system is designed as cost resources to spend the cards.

### Colony Expansion

Players expand their colony by constructing new facilities and exploring the alien planet. Expansion unlocks new opportunities and challenges, requiring strategic planning and resource allocation.

## Player Feedback

Players love the art direction and the unique blend of deck-building and colony management mechanics. Many Players struggling on learning the tutorial which will be improved in future updates. Some players have suggested improvements to the user interface and additional content to enhance the overall experience.

### Audiences

Card game enthusiasts, strategy game players, and fans of colony management simulations.

### Results

Its for competition for Mage XII and we won 1st gold, however the game is still in development and will be released in Q2 2026. The game has received positive feedback from playtesters and negative feedback about UX, with many praising its unique mechanics and engaging gameplay but hard to learn tutorial.

- Add More Card variants and improve UX especially on tutorial and onboarding experience.
- Optimize performance for mobile devices.
- Implement EoS features for cross-platform play and leaderboards.
- Implement EoS features for Title Storage, Player Storage, and Achievements.
