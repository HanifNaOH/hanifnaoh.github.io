## Why compare Azure and AWS for games?

I spun up both a **multiplayer lobby service** and a **dedicated game-server fleet** to measure cost, latency, and developer friction on each cloud. Here’s what stood out once I put real players on the servers.

## TL;DR (Game-Dev Edition)

|                           | **AWS**                                           | **Azure**                                        |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Game-specific PaaS**    | GameLift (managed servers), GameSparks, IVS, Nimble Studio | PlayFab (backend + LiveOps), Azure Gaming VMs |
| **Latency coverage**      | 33 regions, Global Accelerator for UDP            | 65+ regions, Azure Front Door Anycast            |
| **Burst scaling**         | Spot fleets & GameLift FlexMatch auto-scale in 1–2 mins | PlayFab Multiplayer Servers scale in ~3-4 mins |
| **Free egress**           | 100 GB / month                                    | 100 GB / month                                   |
| **Exclusive perks**       | Graviton instances (cheap CPU) + Trainium GPUs    | Managed GPT-4o endpoints for in-game AI/NPCAI    |

## Azure for game back-ends

* **PlayFab** – Drop-in player data, leaderboards, CloudScript, commerce, and LiveOps dashboards. Great for cross-platform titles (Xbox, PC, mobile).  
* **Azure Container Apps / AKS** – Useful when you need custom match instances or authoritative physics servers.  
* **Azure Front Door + Anycast** – Global entry point; auto-routes players to the nearest region and mitigates basic DDoS.  
* **Azure OpenAI Service** – Handy for procedural dialogue or real-time moderation without juggling a separate OpenAI account.

> **Cost gotchas**  
>
> * Leaving a compute node in *Stopped (Allocated)* still bills vCPU/RAM—remember to **deallocate**.  
> * PlayFab’s free tier is generous for indies (up to 100 K MAU) but jumps sharply once you exceed limits.

## AWS for game back-ends

* **GameLift** – Managed fleet + FlexMatch matchmaking. Per-second billing and built-in Spot capacity make it inexpensive for spiky player traffic.  
* **Global Accelerator** – Anycast IPs with UDP acceleration; lowers first-hop latency for shooter or MOBA net-code.  
* **Graviton (Arm) EC2** – Up to 40 % cheaper CPU if your dedicated server binary builds for Arm.  
* **GameSparks** – Managed player data & Cloud Code option if you prefer AWS over PlayFab.

> **Cost perks**  
>
> * When an EC2 instance or GameLift fleet is fully **stopped**, compute costs drop to zero—only EBS persists.  
> * 100 GB of free egress offsets patch distribution or CDN spillover.

## Head-to-head for common game scenarios

| Scenario                                          | Better fit | Why                                                      |
|---------------------------------------------------|-----------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Peer-hosted or server-authoritative FPS**       | **AWS**   | GameLift low-latency UDP + Spot savings                  |
| **Cross-platform social RPG with LiveOps**        | **Azure** | PlayFab built-in economy, events, segmentation           |
| **AI-driven NPC dialogue or toxicity filter**     | **Azure** | Azure OpenAI Service, no extra contracts                 |
| **Indie co-op title, dev budget < \$50 / month**  | **Tie**   | Both have free/spot tiers—AWS slightly easier to pause   |
| **eSports tournament with strict region routing** | **AWS**   | Global Accelerator + latency-based routing               |

## Latency snapshots (my test cohort, May 2025)

* **US East → Frankfurt**  
  * AWS Global Accelerator: 84 ms average RTT  
  * Azure Front Door: 88 ms average RTT  
* **Tokyo → Sydney**  
  * AWS: 111 ms  
  * Azure: 109 ms  

Both networks are neck-and-neck; route diversity matters more than absolute best case. Always test from your players’ ISPs. There are not much differences here

## Final thoughts

* **Go Azure** if you want PlayFab’s turnkey LiveOps or cheaper Windows licences, or you plan heavy AI integration via Azure OpenAI.  
* **Go AWS** if you need per-second fleet scaling, aggressively stop servers in off-hours, or want to squeeze cost with Arm Spot instances.  

Whichever cloud you pick, *measure first, refactor later*. Long-running games live or die on latency and predictable bills.
