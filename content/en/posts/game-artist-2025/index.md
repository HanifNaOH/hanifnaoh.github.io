## Introduction

In the ever-evolving landscape of game development, the role of a game artist is becoming increasingly demanding, even after the rise of AI which may discourage some people. So, i create a standard according my experience leading some artists. This also based on SKKNI (Standar Kompetensi Kerja Nasional Indonesia) which is a national standard for work competencies in Indonesia in 2024. This article created for GameSeed 2025, a game development event in Indonesia.

## Roadmap

### Art Basics

You are game artist and you have to know the basics of art. This is the foundation of your work. You should be able to create basic shapes, understand color theory, and have a good grasp of perspective.

### Anatomy/Figure

WIP

### Color, Lighting, and Shading

WIP

### Tools and Software

WIP

### Practice, Applied, and Feedback

Practice, applied on the game project, and feedback are crucial for your growth as a game artist. You should be able to apply what you learn in real projects and get feedback from your peers and mentors.

Some of the forms of Game Art is not limited to:

#### Concept Art

Seems easy, but its **hard to master.** Because most of the time you trace the concept art from other artists, and you have to create your own style. You should be able to create concept art for **characters**, **environments**, and **props**. Dont be like an AI that just blatantly copy and paste(it's not wrong tho). Here is example of Space for The Unbound Artbook and Super Mario Odyssey Artbook.

#### Character

Okay, now you have the character concept, now draw it, and **put it in the game**. Here is example of Space for The Unbound Artbook. You should be able to create characters that fit in the game. This includes designing their **appearance, vibes, until the story**. As you can see, each character has its own unique style and personality, which is reflected in their design and pose.

#### Environment and Level

Okay, you may need to be architecture lover, this is the most important part of the game. You should be able to create worlds that fit the game's style and theme. This includes designing the **layout**, **props**, and **atmosphere** of the environment that may fit, **discuss with Game Designer** what the environment needs (mostly so we game designer could reuse the assets and make it efficient).

#### Animation

{{< youtubeLite id="V7rlHwHoz6s" label="animation" params="start=130" >}}

Cool drawing, lets animate it, **how much time does it take?** This includes character animations, environment animations, and sometimes UI animations. Make sure the quality of the animation is good and **fits the game's style** and **consistent**. Dont forget the burden of **12 Principles of Animation**.

#### UI/UX Design

![UI UX Process](https://images.ctfassets.net/aq13lwl6616q/6icN0fo3SDVKOxyNI0jEHV/e073cbb8713c2125e5004048a5115192/1_-_Sketching.jpg)
Typography, color, and layout are important in UI/UX design. You should be able to create user interfaces that are easy to use and fit the game's style. This includes designing menus, buttons, and other UI elements that enhance the player's experience. It includes from paper to implementation, which sometimes requires VFX and heavy animations, and lot of attention to detail.

I recomend you to see [Game UI DB](https://www.gameuidatabase.com/) for references. What kind of texture, what kind of **color**, what kind of **layout**, and what kind of **typography** that fits the game.

For the output format, see [Kenney](https://kenney.nl/assets/tag:interface?sort=update) for the **output examples**. They provide the minimum requirements for the UI/UX design, which is **very easy for game programmers** to implement. For more advance thing here is accesibility requirements, you can see [Game Accessibility Guidelines](https://gameaccessibilityguidelines.com/).
