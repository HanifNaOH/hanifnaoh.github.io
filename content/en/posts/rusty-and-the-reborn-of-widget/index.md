This may be overwhelming at frist but for programmers, this is the complexity of the game systems that make it so engaging. The game is built around a series of interconnected systems that allow players to manage resources, automate tasks, and progress through a farming simulation. (Quality of life not included in this breakdown lol)

### Game Core Loop

{{< /mermaid >}}
For non-programmers, the core loop of the game can be summarized as follows:

1. Start the game and let crops grow idly.
2. Check if any crops are mature for harvesting.
3. If yes, harvest the crops and collect resources.
4. Allocate resources either to reinvest in the farm or hold for later.
5. Decide whether to buy upgrades or hire new helpers.
6. Repeat the loop.

{{< youtubeLite id="6FR0zOl6V3Q" label="Soundtrack Rusty" >}}

Chilling and relaxing music. If you have any idea what type of music this is, please let me know. But for me its just chill.

For the SFX, there is not much since the game intent to not distract you while you are doing other tasks. The game has a few sound effects for actions like planting, harvesting, and watering crops, but they are subtle and not intrusive.
