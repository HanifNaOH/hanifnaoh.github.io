Okay, I build a lot of systems, but **systems have always been patterns**. Recognizing and understanding these patterns is **crucial** for any game developer. Common patterns include the Entity-Component-System (ECS) architecture, state machines, and event-driven programming. Familiarity with these patterns will enable you to design more efficient and maintainable code. So you could thank for your past self for learning these patterns and apply it in your game project. See more [Game Programming Patterns](https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/contents.html) or watch it on YT for more insights.

## Strong STEM Skills

A game programmer must have a basic skillset in STEM(Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics). This includes a solid understanding of algorithms, data structures, and mathematics. You should be able to apply these concepts to solve complex problems in game development, for example Physics Manipulation and problem solving, highly recommend at least understand **Dynamic Programming**.

## Game AI

Game AI is a crucial aspect of modern game development. You should be familiar with various AI techniques, including pathfinding, decision trees, behavior trees, state machine, and Goal Action Planning. Understanding how to implement AI systems that can adapt to player actions and provide a challenging experience is essential. Familiarity with machine learning concepts can also be beneficial, as more games are incorporating AI-driven features make the AI more human like, the recent advancement is using OpenAI Key as NPC where you could talk realtime.

## FrontEnd

Okay this is basicly the Game Engine, you should be familiar with game engines like Unity, Unreal Engine, Godot. Understanding how to create and manage game objects, scenes, and assets is essential. You should also be able to implement game mechanics, physics, and animations using the engine's scripting language. Familiarity with game engine architecture, including rendering pipelines and input systems, will help you create more efficient and optimized games.

## BackEnd

Where do player data stored? At the backend, of course. You should be familiar with server-side programming languages like Node.js, Python, or Java. Understanding how to create and manage databases is also essential such as SQL based, as player data needs to be stored securely and efficiently. Familiarity with RESTful APIs and web services will help you integrate your game with online features. Server management, including deployment and scaling, is also a crucial skill for game programmers. Since it online, you have to learn networking concepts, including protocols, latency, and bandwidth management. Understanding how to optimize network performance is essential for creating smooth multiplayer experiences.

## Game Graphics

Shaders, rendering techniques, and optimization are crucial for creating visually stunning games. You should be familiar with graphics APIs like OpenGL, DirectX, or Vulkan, and understand how to implement shaders to achieve various visual effects. You have to understand the basics of vertex and fragment shaders, and how they interact with the graphics pipeline. Familiarity with tools like Unity with their shader graph or Unreal Engine with MaterialShader can also be beneficial, as they provide powerful graphics capabilities out of the box.

## KISS, DRY, and SOLID Principles

Okay dont be over do it without testing it, dont ever push untested code to production or even to the main branch. Always test your code before deploying it. This will help you catch bugs and issues early, and ensure that your code is stable and reliable.

**KISS** (Keep It Simple, Stupid) means should be simple and straightforward. Avoid unnecessary complexity in your code.

**DRY** (Don't Repeat Yourself) use plugins or built-in functions, reusable components, and libraries to avoid redundancy. This will make your code more maintainable and easier to read.

**SOLID** principles are a set of design principles that help you create more maintainable and scalable code(especially if its teamworks). These principles include:

- **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: A class should have only one reason to change.
- **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**: Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.
- **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**: Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program.
- **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**: Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.
- **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
