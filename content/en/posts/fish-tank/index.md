## Core Loop

1. **Catch Fish**: Players use various tools and strategies to catch different species of fish, each with unique attributes and values.
2. **Collect**: Caught fish are added to the player's aquarium, where they could have mutations which increase the sell value.
3. **Sell Fish for Resources**: Players can sell their collected fish to earn in-game currency, which can be used to purchase better equipment and upgrades, enhancing their fishing capabilities.

## Gameplay

### Resizable window

Inspired by Rusty Retirement, players can play the game while doing other tasks on their device by minimizing the game window to a small resizable overlay.

### Idle Tycoon
