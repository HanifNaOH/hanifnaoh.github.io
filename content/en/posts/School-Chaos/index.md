# Pandemic

Just like others, online school is boring. So i started to learn game development. I started with Godot Engine since its lite and doesn't need a lot of resources. I started with a simple game, a platformer game.

## AGI

Then coincidentally a few months later [AGI](https://www.agi.or.id) held a [Game Development Competition](https://web.archive.org/web/20230605084243/https://www.agi.or.id/lombavokasi). So i decided to join the competition. The theme of the competition is Educational Game for Vocational Training. I made an educational game about coffee industry for Kementerian Ketenagakerjaan, it narrates how Luwak made coffee from coffee plantation. Won second place despite being the only high school and able to beat a team of 3 people from vocational high school by myself, it was turning point for me.

Here is the clip of the game called __Luwak Adventure__ that i made:

## Compfest 14

After the competition, i decided to join another competition. This time it's [Compfest 14](https://compfest.id). I formed a small team consist of 3 people. We decided to make a game about metroidvania. For 30 days of struggle sadly we didn't make it through the final. But we still proud of our work and we try to do it better next time. Mainly i'm the one who did the game design, UI programming, and some of the art. [Deka](https://www.instagram.com/dk_0280705/) for the more complex programming such as the platformer physics, game mechanics, he also compose the music and draw the main character. Others is [Zio](https://www.instagram.com/zeeyowo/) for pixel artist and [Azfa](https://www.instagram.com/azfahermawan_/) for additional programming and level design.

Here is the clip of the game we made called __May I Return__ that we made:

## GACCI 2022

After Compfest 14, i decided to join another competition. This time it's [GACCI 2022](https://socs.binus.ac.id/beefest/). Another competition show up, this time it's a competition held by [Binus University](https://binus.ac.id). This competition is a bit different from the previous one. This time we have to make a game design document(which i never did before), so i eager to learn what is game design document. I got into the final and some of my friends from AGI Competition also get into the final. We have to do sort of [game pitching](https://www.masterclass.com/articles/how-to-pitch-a-video-game) for the jury. I got the 1st place and my friends got the 2nd place. Apparently i made it to the final because of my game design document is the longest and the most complex one. I tried to make a fusion game of [Papers Please](https://papersplea.se) and [Cooking Mama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooking_Mama_(video_game)) on Indonesian Independence Day theme. The prize is a fullscholarship for Binus University.

## GIM JAM ITB 2023

It's a 7 days game jam basicly, with the theme of "Meme Indonesia". I made a game about [Meth, Magician, and Latto-latto](https://koloid-studios.itch.io/meth-magician-and-latto-latto). Because meme is vary, i decided to put 3 meme in one game. I made it to become the [Winner of Best Game Award](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10hS57oMMFb21nFxHxSw8UPBavAjYcGWg/view?usp=share_link). I made this game with [Deka](https://www.instagram.com/dk_0280705/), [Zio](https://www.instagram.com/zeeyowo/). We made this game using kinematic skeleton to animate the character, it's save a lot of time.

## Global Game Jam 2023

It's a 48 hours offline game jam with "Root" as a theme. The event supported by [GameLan.YK](https://www.instagram.com/gamelan.yk/), I made the level design based on the Team Lead direction and searched for some audio assets for the game. I met a lot of new people and had a lot of fun, we got a visit from [Kementerian Pariwisata dan Ekonomi Kreatif](https://kemenparekraf.go.id), Muhammad Neil El Himam and Sandiaga Uno.

Here is the clip of the game we made called __Stay Hydrated!__ that we made:

## Tono

My experiment for 3D game, probably my shamest work. I made this game for Vocachamp 2023. Made with the new Godot Engine 4, 3D assets with Blender, audio with BeepBox, drawing with Krita, video editing software with KDEnLive. I made a Hamster Ball game like. Beside my shamest work i also proud of this work because i made it all by myself. I made the 3D assets, the music, the sound effect, the game design, the programming, the level design, the UI, the video editing, and the game trailer. I made this game in 2 weeks.
